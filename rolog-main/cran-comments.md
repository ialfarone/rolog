## Comment

The dependency package DiagrammeR is currently not available on CRAN. It is not
needed for the present package (just a figure in the package vignette). I have
temporarily disabled the figure, so that the CRAN checks now hopefully pass.

Speed of compilation has been slightly increased under Windows (14 to 12 min on my old laptop).
