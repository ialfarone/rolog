# rolog: Access SWI-Prolog from R

The logic programming language Prolog was invented in the 1970ies by Alain
Colmerauer, mostly for the purpose of natural language processing. Since then,
logic programming has become an important driving force in research on artificial
intelligence, natural language processing, program analysis, knowledge
representation and theorem proving. 

\(a + b^2\)

SWI-Prolog (https://www.swi-prolog.org/) is an open-source implementation of the
logic programming language Prolog. SWI-Prolog targets developers of applications,
with many users in academia, research and industry. SWI-Prolog includes a 
large number of libraries for "the real world", for example, a web server,
encryption, interfaces to C/C++ and other programming languages, as well as a
development environment and debugger.

This R package connects to SWI-Prolog.

## License

This R package is distributed under a BSD-2 simplified license (see the file LICENSE).

## Why is it called rolog?

I guess the name is obvious, rolog = Prolog for R. The package only connects to the
SWI-Prolog runtime and does not embed it. rolog supports the following installations
of SWI-Prolog, with decreasing priority:

* If the environment variable `SWI_HOME_DIR` is set, the respective installation is
  used.
* If swipl.exe is found on the PATH, that one is used.
* (Windows only): If SWI-Prolog is installed in the system, a respective entry is
  found in the registry.
* SWI-Prolog from the R package rswipl

# Installation

## Linux

1. Please install SWI-Prolog on your computer, see here: https://www.swi-prolog.org/build/PPA.html.
   Alternatively, install the R package rswipl.

2. You obviously need R and a few packages on your computer, maybe also rmarkdown and pandoc
   to render Rmd files to html (see Example 2).

`sudo apt install r-base pandoc pandoc-citeproc`

`R`

`install.packages("Rcpp", "rmarkdown", "remotes")`

optional: `install.packages("rswipl")`

3. Please install the "rolog" pack for R

`install.packages("rolog")`

Then please move on to the examples.

## macOS

1. Please install SWI-Prolog on your computer, see here: https://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable
   Alternatively, install the R package rswipl.

2. You obviously need R and a few packages on your computer, maybe also rmarkdown and pandoc 
   to render Rmd files to html (see Example 2).

`brew install r-base pandoc pandoc-citeproc`

`R`

`install.packages("Rcpp", "rmarkdown", "remotes")`

optional: `install.packages("rswipl")`

3. Please install the "rolog" pack for R

`install_packages("rolog")`

## Windows

1. Download and install a recent R from https://www.r-project.org/

2. Download and install a recent RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/

3. Download and install a recent SWI-Prolog from https://www.swi-prolog.org/

optional: R> `install.packages("rswipl")`

install.packages("rolog")

R> `library(rolog)`

# Examples

## Example 1

This is a hello(world).

R> `library(rolog)`

Run a query such as member(X, [1, 2, 3]) with 

R> `findall(call("member", expression(X), list(1L, 2L, 3L)))`

Sorry for the cumbersome syntax. At the moment, expression(X) encapsulates variables. The query 
returns bindings for X that satisfy member(X, [1, 2, 3]).

## Example 2

The second example is the vignette with nice use cases in Section 4.

`rmarkdown::render(system.file("vignettes", "rolog.Rmd", package="rolog"), output_file="rolog.html", output_dir=getwd())`

You should find an HTML page in `rolog.html` of the current folder. Note that it includes equations with MathML, which look
best in the Firefox browser.
